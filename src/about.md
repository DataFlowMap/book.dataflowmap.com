## Not Just Another Programming Manual

In today's data-rich world, clarity is the real challenge. **The Data Flow Map** simplifies complexity into three core motions—source, focus, build—along with the section tagging action.

This book transcends tools and platforms to provide a framework for thinking and communicating about data at a higher level. Whether you're working in spreadsheets, databases, or AI models, you'll learn to elevate your analytical skills, tell compelling stories, and align your team for smarter decisions.

## What You'll Learn

### The Framework

The Data Flow Map introduces a universal mental model for data analysis built on:

- **Source**: Understanding where your data comes from
- **Focus**: Identifying what matters in your dataset
- **Build**: Constructing insights and transformations
- **Section Tagging**: Organizing and documenting your process

### Two-Part Approach

**Part One: Concepts and Theory**
The first half lays out the core concepts with illustrations and stories, helping you develop the mental model needed for effective data analysis.

**Part Two: Practical Applications**
The second half applies these concepts to real data using tools like Python, SQL, and Excel, showing you how the framework works in practice.

## Why This Book Matters

As tools have improved—becoming more user-friendly and capable of handling larger datasets—how we think and share our processes hasn't evolved much. The most complex problems in data analysis aren't about sourcing, cleaning data, or mastering specific tools. 

The hardest challenges involve:
- Thinking differently about solutions
- Sharing and brainstorming ideas with teams
- Switching between platforms seamlessly
- Documenting processes for future users

**The Data Flow Map** addresses these challenges head-on, empowering analysts at any level to approach data with confidence, precision, and insight.
