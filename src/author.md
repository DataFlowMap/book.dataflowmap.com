## Nick Ryberg

Nick Ryberg has developed analytics across platforms, from Microsoft Excel and Access to more complex systems such as Postgres, Hadoop, and Spark SQL. Whether working on personal computers, Linux servers, mainframes, or even a Raspberry Pi, Nick thrives with a keyboard and a table or two of data.

### The Challenge That Inspired This Book

As tools have improved, becoming more user-friendly and capable of handling larger datasets, Nick observed that how we think and share our processes hasn't evolved much.

Throughout Nick's career, the focus has been on solving challenging analytic problems using these tools. The most complex problems encountered aren't related to:
- Sourcing data
- Cleaning data
- Mastering specific tools

Instead, the most difficult aspects involve:
- **Thinking differently** about solutions
- **Sharing and brainstorming** ideas with team members
- **Switching platforms** seamlessly
- **Documenting processes** for future users

This realization led to the creation of The Data Flow Map framework—a way to think about and communicate data analysis that transcends any single tool or platform.

### Experience Across the Stack

Nick's diverse experience spans:
- Spreadsheet applications (Excel, Google Sheets)
- Desktop databases (Access)
- Enterprise databases (Postgres, SQL Server)
- Big data platforms (Hadoop, Spark SQL)
- Various computing environments (personal computers, Linux servers, mainframes, Raspberry Pi)

This breadth of experience informs the universal approach taken in **The Data Flow Map**, making it relevant regardless of your current tech stack.
