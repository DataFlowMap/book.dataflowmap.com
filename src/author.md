I have developed analytics across a wide variety of platforms, from Microsoft Excel and Access to more complex systems such as Postgres, Hadoop, DuckDB, and Spark SQL. Whether working on personal computers, Linux servers, mainframes, or even a Raspberry Pi, I thrive with a keyboard and a table or two of data.

During the day, I work on sustainability data analysis and visualization for a large corporation.  By night, I love to cook, binge-watch terrible shows, and build one-off data-focused apps. I also enjoy playing video games and learning new programming languages, frameworks, and data visualization tools - just for the heck of it. 

### Experience Across the Stack

My experience spans:
- Spreadsheet applications (Excel, Google Sheets)
- Desktop databases (Access)
- Enterprise databases (Postgres, SQL Server, DuckDB)
- Big data platforms (Hadoop, Spark SQL)
- Various computing environments (personal computers, Linux servers, mainframes, Raspberry Pi)

This breadth of experience informs the universal approach taken in **The Data Flow Map**, making it relevant regardless of your current tech stack.
