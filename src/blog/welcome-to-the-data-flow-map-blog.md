Welcome to The Data Flow Map blog! This space is dedicated to exploring the concepts, applications, and thinking patterns that make data analysis more effective and intuitive.

## What to Expect

In this blog, we'll dive deeper into topics from the book, including:

- **Conceptual frameworks** for understanding data transformations
- **Practical examples** across different tools and platforms
- **Case studies** applying the Data Flow Map methodology
- **Tips and techniques** for clearer data communication
- **Updates and resources** for readers and practitioners

## The Three Core Motions

At the heart of The Data Flow Map are three essential movements that guide every data analysis:

1. **Source** - Bringing data into your workspace
2. **Focus** - Narrowing down to what matters
3. **Build** - Creating new insights and transformations

These simple motions, combined with section tagging, provide a universal language for thinking about data work regardless of the tool you're using.

## Join the Conversation

Whether you're working in Python, SQL, Excel, or any other analytics platform, the Data Flow Map framework helps you think at a higher level. This blog will continue that conversation with practical insights and real-world applications.

Stay tuned for more posts on data analysis, visualization, and the art of clear thinking about data flows.
